# Info

★ GWA is back! ★
GWA4 is most powerful gomoku&renju engine in Scratch. Play on turbowarp is more good:

★ See All GWA Series ★
https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27059953/

★ Features ★
Now GWA4 can support renju rule, and change board size. Also it is more faster in scratch(x1.5~2), and turbowarp(x20~). I don't know exactly reason, GWA2~3 didn't work in turbowarp, but GWA4 work in turbowarp.

★ Links ★
This project is so large and use stamp(pen). So I recommend to play on turbowarp or packaged link. Also if you want, you can play GWA4 on old GUI(GWA3).
